Vangrant configuration for Constest Management System used in IOI style competitions and trainings

## Current Set Up

* Ubuntu 32bits 14.04
* CMS 1.1

My friends use *bootstrap.sh* to install CMS on Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 but they required to install two additional things in order to import a contest in italian format.

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    pip install pyyaml
